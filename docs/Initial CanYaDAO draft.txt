Universal CanYaDAO Initial Draft
---------------------------------	

Organisation is an entity that "employees" people to do "tasks" then "pays" them.

DAO is a borderless organisation that exists everywhere.

CanYaDAO is an outsource DAO that manages employees to do tasks defined by other clients "Apps"

CanYaDAO 
	Entities:
		- DAOEmp: a user joins the DAO and stakes CAN tokens
		- Role (Mod/Admin/...etc): set of permissions assigned to users based on their staked tokens, employment period and rating
		- Task: A guid defined by external actor (App/Client) describes what the task is and how to complete it.
		- App: DAO client that defines tasks to be carried out by DAO employees
	Flow:
		- A client registers at CanYaDAO and get a clientID & auth tokens
		- The client login, create task and stakes the task max payable in return he gets a successTriggerURL
		- DAO display the task to relevant DAOEmp
		- DAOEmp logins to the client APP
		- The client authenticates the DAOEmp by calling the DAO "auth" endpoint passing through the DAOEmp credentials (address or username * pass)
		- DAOEmp execute the task as per defined
		- The client calls the successTriggerURL when a task is completed as per his criteria passing through the employee address, appRefId
		- Task is considered completed if the task defined capacity is reached (ex: 500 application processed)
		- Task may contain expiry time or continue till terminated rule
		- A client needs to charge his account (stake tokens) when it goes below a given threshold 
	API:
		- POST /CanYaDAO/Auth: 					autehnticates a DAOEmp by address or email/pass
		- POST /CanYaDAO/task: 					creates a new task
		- PUT  /CanYaDAO/task/id: 				updates a task
		- POST /CanYaDAO/client: 				creates a new client and returns client id
		- GET  /CanYaDAO/oauth/: 				returns bearer authentication token to the client app
		- GET  /CanYaDAO/client/id/balance 		returns remaining account balance
		- GET  /CanYaDAO/task/id/balance 		returns remaining task balance
		- POST /CanYaDAO/task/id/complete 		increments the task processed records and pays the DAOEmp


CanYaDAO Employee Signup:
	- Capture email, mobile, name, ethAddress during signup.

Task Definition:

	- Define completion action "Final event to be triggered that indicates task is completed"
	- Define "measured" criteria to be followed by moderators/admins to complete the task
